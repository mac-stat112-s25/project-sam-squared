Data source: Vermont Center for Geographic Information (VCGI), https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/invasive-species-812ab\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Hemlock Woolly Adelgid, or HWA, is categorized under the label “NA.” This is because it isn’t a plant at all! HWA is actually an aphid-like insect native to East Asia. According to the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, HWA can infest and kill native Eastern Hemlock trees, wreaking havoc on local ecosystems. HWA uses its long mouthparts to suck out a tree’s starches, preventing the tree from delivering nutrients to its branches and needles.\nEastern Hemlock trees are important to North American ecosystems for a number of reasons. The evergreen trees act as year-round shelters for a variety of species, from lichens on the forest floor to warblers and owls in the canopy. Local deer and moose populations also rely on hemlock needles for nutrition. Additionally, the trees’ thick foliage create shade, helping regulate temperatures in terrestrial and aquatic environments.\nFurther reading: https://fpr.vermont.gov/sites/fpr/files/Forest_and_Forestry/Forest_Health/Library/VTFPR_HWAinVT_RecommendationsforLandownerResponse.pdf https://dec.ny.gov/nature/animals-fish-plants/insects-and-other-species/hemlock-woolly-adelgid\n\n\n\n\nBar graph of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid sightings in Vermont, by year.

Data source: Vermont Center for Geographic Information (VCGI), https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/invasive-species-812ab\n\n\n\nAs this map makes clear, Hemlock Woolly Adelgid sightings were highly concentrated in Windham County until 2020. Since then, it has been spotted in various locations across the state. This is likely due to a large infestation of HWA in Massachusetts which borders the county. According to an article by the University of Massachusetts (linked below), HWA landed in southern New England on the winds of a hurricane in 1980 from more southern states. It would make sense, then, that HWA reached Vermont by first travelling north through Massachusetts.\nArticle link: https://www.umass.edu/agriculture-food-environment/landscape/fact-sheets/hemlock-woolly-adelgid-frequently-asked-questions",

    "text": "We looked at the New York City Uber article as our case study. We found that the article was fascinating in how it seamlessly integrated the graphs into the text as well as using multiple different graph types such as line charts, scatter plots, and choropleth maps. The article is very effective at not overloading the reader with too many numbers and is very readable. We particularly liked the choropleth maps that showed how taxi services declined in some regions in New York. They also note flaws and potential mis-correlations the reader might make and correct their narrative. Overall, it’s interesting because they make a compelling argument about their data and why it matters in the grand scheme of competition in the taxi/ride industry. We hope to be able to mimic this in our project",

Creating roles also increases team cohesion, as each member understands how their work will effect the work of others. Additionally, good teamwork requires effective listening. This means making sure every team member feels heard and knows their ideas are valued. This also means being attuned to unspoken feelings or tensions within the team. Thirdly, team members should set rules and expectations for each other before starting a project. This will help the team avoid and resolve potential conflicts.",

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310384/\nSummary: This article is interesting in that it’s organized like a scientific article. It’s cool in that it describes and explains “simple” or “common sense” good teamwork aspects in a more scientific method. While the article focuses on Science research groups but should also apply in general. Main points include mental models, cognitive interactions, team climate and psychological safety. These points boil down to creating a space where people feel safe, respected, heard and free to take risks. The point being that people work best when comfortable. The rest of the article talks about Team Efficacy and how it’s effected by Team Cohesion and how to measure Team Effectiveness. This can be simplified to how teams work better when people do what they’re good at, don’t argue/ can resolve arguments well and then you can measure group effectiveness on. Mostly it’s about how much people get done and how they feel emotionally while getting it done. This article is interesting for focusing on rescearching team effectiveness.",
